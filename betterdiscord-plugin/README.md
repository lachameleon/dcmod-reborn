# External [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) Plugin Installation Guide

> [!WARNING]
> The "Forward to Discord" feature (which automatically sends Minecraft chat messages to Discord channels) may be considered **self-botting** and could violate Discord's Terms of Service. Using automated message sending features in public Discord servers may result in account action. It is highly recommend to create a new **private** Discord server dedicated and configured to the plugin.

1. Download `MinecraftChat.plugin.js` from the latest [release](https://github.com/aurickk/Discord-Chat-Integration/releases) page.

2. Navigate to User Settings → BetterDiscord → Plugin.

3. Click on the top left "Open Plugin Folder" folder icon button.

4. Move `MinecraftChat.plugin.js` into the newly opened directory.

5. Enable the MinecraftChat plugin in the BetterDiscord plugins menu.
